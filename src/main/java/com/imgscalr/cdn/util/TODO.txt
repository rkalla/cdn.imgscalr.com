Introduce a logging util that abstracts out the different types of logging
messages like info, error, performance and offers the ability to async queue up
and write out performance metrics to a remote DB for later analysis.

NOTE: Should I do that or implement a custom logback logger that does the work and
just utilize TRACE types to track performance? That would be more robust.
